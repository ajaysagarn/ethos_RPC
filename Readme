The homework implementation has the following files:
AccountServer.go - Implementation for a AccountServer that accepts Network request
AccountClient1.go - Implemtation for a AccountClient that sends requests and accepts server responses
AccountClient2.go - Implemtation for a AccountClient that sends requests and accepts server responses
accountsRpc.t - The type file containing ETN for BankAccount type and AccountRpc interface
log - Copy of the server generated log by running the program.


Running the HW:
1. From the Homework directory run `make clean install`
2. Navigate into server/ folder `cd server/`
3. Execute the command `sudo ethosRun -t`
4. View the logs by executing the command `ethosLog .`


Implementation Details:

The implementation consists of a simple AccountRpc interface that has methods to check the balance and transfer an amount from one
account to another. Two Clients are created to generate predefined balance and transfer requests that get sent to the server using 
altEthos Ipc and ClientCall() methods. The implementation assumes that both clients have access to all the accounts present in the
and are able to perform all operations on all accounts.

The server uses a BankAccount type and generate a set of Accounts of type BankAccount when first initialised. These accounts are
stored in a users accounts folder where each account filename is the account number. These files are then read using the account
number provided by the clients to perform the requred operations. Error and operations performed are Logged on both the server and
the client programs.
